# Challenge Creator Guidelines

## Overview
Creating engaging challenges in Linkaroo requires thoughtful image selection and clear descriptions. Follow these guidelines to ensure your challenges are fun, fair, and accessible to all players.

## Image Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: PNG, JPEG, or GIF
- **Size**: Maximum 20MB per image
- **Quantity**: Minimum 2 images, maximum 3 images
- **Display**: Images are automatically formatted to display as squares (1:1 aspect ratio) in the game

### Content Guidelines

#### ✅ DO:
- **Use clear, high-quality images** that clearly show the connection
- **Choose images with good contrast** and visibility
- **Select images that have an obvious logical connection** to your answer
- **Use images that are appropriate for all audiences**
- **Ensure images are relevant to your chosen themes/tags**
- **Write descriptive, helpful image descriptions** (these become hints!)
- **Test your challenge logic** - would someone else see the connection?

#### ❌ DON'T:
- **Use blurry, pixelated, or low-quality images**
- **Include text-heavy images** where the answer is just reading text
- **Choose images with inappropriate, offensive, or NSFW content**
- **Use copyrighted images** without permission
- **Make connections that are too obscure** or require specialized knowledge
- **Leave image descriptions empty** - they're required and become valuable hints
- **Use images where the connection is purely coincidental**

### Image Description Best Practices

Image descriptions serve as **hints** when players spend points to reveal them. Write descriptions that:

- **Are 1-2 sentences long**
- **Provide helpful context** without giving away the answer
- **Describe what's shown** and hint at its relevance
- **Use clear, simple language**
- **Guide players toward the connection** without being too obvious

**Example:**
- Image: A photo of a lighthouse
- Good description: "A tall structure that guides ships safely to shore during storms"
- Poor description: "Lighthouse" (too obvious) or "Building" (too vague)

## Answer Guidelines

### Correct Answer
- **Be specific but not overly narrow** - "Dog" is better than "Golden Retriever" for general dog images
- **Use common terminology** that most people would recognize
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless they're widely known
- **Consider synonyms** - the AI will generate variations, but start with the most common term

### Answer Explanation
- **Explain the connection clearly** - this helps players understand after they solve or fail
- **Keep it concise** but informative (2-3 sentences)
- **Mention how each image relates** to the answer
- **Use encouraging, educational tone**

**Example:**
"All three images show different types of bridges - the Golden Gate Bridge, a stone arch bridge, and a wooden footbridge. Despite their different materials and purposes, they all serve the same function of connecting two places across a gap."

## Theme Selection

### Choosing Themes
- **Select 1-3 relevant themes** that accurately describe your challenge
- **Use specific themes** when possible (e.g., "Animals" rather than just "Nature")
- **Consider your audience** - popular themes get more visibility
- **Match the difficulty** to your theme (e.g., "Expert" themes should be challenging)

### Popular Themes
- Animals, Food, Travel, Movies, Sports, History, Science, Art, Music, Geography

## Challenge Difficulty

### Easy Challenges
- **Obvious visual connections** (all images show the same type of thing)
- **Common knowledge** required
- **Clear, direct relationships**

### Medium Challenges  
- **Conceptual connections** (images share a theme or purpose)
- **Some thinking required** but not specialized knowledge
- **Multiple valid interpretations** possible

### Hard Challenges
- **Abstract or metaphorical connections**
- **Require broader knowledge** or cultural awareness
- **Subtle relationships** that need careful observation

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting your challenge, ask yourself:

- [ ] Are all images clear and high-quality?
- [ ] Is the connection between images logical and fair?
- [ ] Would someone else be able to solve this with the hints?
- [ ] Are my image descriptions helpful but not too obvious?
- [ ] Is my answer explanation clear and educational?
- [ ] Have I selected appropriate themes?
- [ ] Is the challenge appropriate for all audiences?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Obscure**: Connections that require very specialized knowledge
2. **Too Obvious**: Where the answer is immediately apparent from one image
3. **Poor Image Quality**: Blurry, dark, or unclear images
4. **Weak Descriptions**: Vague or unhelpful hint text
5. **Cultural Bias**: References that only work in specific regions/cultures
6. **Text Dependency**: Challenges that require reading text in images

## Rate Limits & Moderation

- **1 challenge per 24 hours** per creator
- **Challenges are reviewed** for quality and appropriateness
- **Inappropriate content** will be removed and may result in creation restrictions
- **Low-quality challenges** may be removed to maintain game quality

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - create a few easy challenges to get familiar with the system
2. **Test with friends** - ask others if they can see the connection
3. **Study popular challenges** - see what works well in the community
4. **Be creative** - unique connections are more memorable and fun
5. **Think about hints** - write descriptions that provide a good progression of help
